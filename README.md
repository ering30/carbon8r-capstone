# CARBON8R

CARBON8R is an essential tool for climate-conscious travellers. Use this calculator to cut through misinformation and get credible carbon emissions data for one-way trips between two destinations. Trustworthy data averages for car, bus, train and airplane journeys are based on international GHG protocol and standards.

## Motivation

For many of us, travel is back on the agenda after a long time staying put (woohoo!). It also means our carbon footprints are climbing again (rats!). Thankfully, CARBON8R provides an easy way for climate-conscious individuals and businesses to access reliable data for their carbon footprint. The goal is to aid in making intelligent travel decisions and to educate and increase awareness about carbon dioxide emissions from travel.
